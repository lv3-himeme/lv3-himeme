## What is this account made for?

Maybe some people seeing this account already know this is my secondary one, and will only be used for uploading extremely meaningless projects (such as the [Nahida](https://github.com/lv3-himeme/Nahida) project). I mean my main account also contains meaningless projects entirely made just for fun, but in this account they're even more meaningless.

## About Me

Check out my main account (if you can find it) to know more about me. This is a half-secret account so I don't want to reveal my information here.

I'm currently a member of [**The Firefly Project**](https://github.com/The-Firefly-Project), a independent group that focuses on translating games and experimenting with some softwares that I know (of course with permissions). The group was just founded not a long time ago, but we will definitely grow more in the future. WE KNOW this name is quite widely used by many other groups, but we still want to use it.
